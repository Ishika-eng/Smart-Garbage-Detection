Smart Garbage Detection and Community Mapping System



This project proposes an AI-based system to automatically detect garbage

from images submitted by citizens and map waste locations using geospatial data.

The system integrates machine learning, backend APIs, a mobile application,

and a web dashboard.



Modules:

1\. Machine Learning

2\. Backend + Database

3\. Mobile App

4\. Web Dashboard



This repository represents a hackathon prototype focused on feasibility

and system design.
